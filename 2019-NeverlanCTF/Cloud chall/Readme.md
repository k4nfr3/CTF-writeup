Sorry but this is an **incomplete** write-up.

I'm putting it up in the hope that somebody will help complete it as I'm really interested to know 
how I should have finished that challenge.

Starting point : http://www.neverlanctf.cloud/

Here is the result of Sublist3r

We see a link to Github http://https://github.com/neverlanctfcloud/level3

It looks like a repository which has been used as source for the cloud instance (check the perl script)

So looking at the file, we see an empty flag, but it gives us the full url to look for

but there it seems i'm stuck. It talked about being loggued on, and I guess it might have been something to do with having a GoogleCloud account.
I've tried post CTF but no change.
So any tips, happy to complete my writeup contact me my DM on Twitter @k4nfr3
